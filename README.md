iotop
=====

Is your Linux server too slow or load is too high? One of the possible
causes of such symptoms may be high IO (input/output) waiting time,
which basically means that some of your processes need to read or write
to a hard drive while it is too slow and not ready yet, serving data for
some other processes. 

Common practice is to use iostat -x in order to find out which block
device (hard drive) is slow, but this information is not always helpful.
It could help you much more if you knew which process reads or writes
the most data from your slow disk, so you could renice it using ionice
or even kill it.

iotop identifies processes that use high amount of input/output requests
on your machine. It is similar to the well known top utility, but
instead of showing you what consumes CPU the most, it lists
processes by their IO usage. Inspired by iotop Python script from
Guillaume Chazarain, rewritten in C by Vyacheslav Trushkin and improved
by Boian Bonev so it runs without Python at all.

Require root access, be noticed in case prompt errors.

<details>
  <summary>Ubuntu</summary>
    
    apt install build-essential ncurses-dev -y
    git clone https://github.com/Tomas-M/iotop
    cd iotop
    make
</details>

<details>
  <summary>CentOS 7</summary>
    CentOS did not pre-install git, manually install might be needed. also install 'epel-release' Package is recommended.
    
    yum install ncurses-devel pkgconfig -y
