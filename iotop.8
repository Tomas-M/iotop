.TH IOTOP "8" "January 13, 2025"
.SH NAME
iotop \- simple top\-like I/O monitor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iotop
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBiotop\fR watches I/O usage information available in the Linux kernel
(requires 2.6.20 or later) and displays a table of current I/O usage by
processes or threads on the system. At least the CONFIG_TASK_DELAY_ACCT,
CONFIG_TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING, CONFIG_TASKSTATS and CONFIG_VM_EVENT_COUNTERS
options need to be enabled in your Linux kernel build configuration.
.PP
Running \fBiotop\fR as non\-root user is possible by adding the NET_ADMIN
capability. This can be done by e.g.:
.RS

.B
$ sudo setcap 'cap_net_admin+eip' <path\-to>/iotop

.RE
Be warned that this will also allow other users to run it and get access to
information that normally should not be available to them.
.PP
\fBiotop\fR displays columns for the I/O bandwidth read and written by each
process/thread during the sampling period. It also displays the percentage
of time the thread/process spent while swapping in and while waiting on I/O.
For each process, its I/O priority (class/level) is shown.
.PP
In addition, the total I/O bandwidth read and written during the sampling
period are displayed at the top of the interface.
\fBTotal DISK READ\fR and \fBTotal DISK WRITE\fR values represent total read
and write bandwidth between processes and kernel threads on one side and
kernel block device subsystem on the other. While \fBCurrent DISK READ\fR and
\fBCurrent DISK WRITE\fR values represent corresponding bandwidths for current
disk I/O between the kernel block device subsystem and the underlying hardware
(HDD, SSD, etc.). Thus \fBTotal\fR and \fBCurrent\fR values may not be equal at
any given moment of time due to data caching and I/O operations reordering that
take place inside the Linux kernel.
.PP
Use the \fBleft\fR and \fBright\fR arrows to select the sort column, \fBr\fR or
\fBspace\fR to reverse the sorting order, \fBo\fR to toggle the \fB\-\-only\fR
option (this uses the visible values from the \fBGRAPH\fR column or the
\fBIO\fR column in case the \fBGRAPH\fR column is hidden), \fBp\fR to toggle
the \fB\-\-processes\fR option, \fBa\fR to cycle between the
\fB\-\-accumulated\fR, \fB\-\-accum\-bw\fR and normal operation,
\fBi\fR to change the priority of a thread or a process's thread,
\fBf\fR to change filtering by \fBUID\fR/\fBPID\fR (\fB\-\-user\fR and
\fB\-\-pid\fR options), \fB1\-9\fR to toggle the visibility of the respective
column, \fB0\fR to show all columns, \fBup\fR/\fBdown\fR arrows,
\fBpage\-up\fR/\fBpage\-down\fR/\fBhome\fR/\fBend\fR keys to scroll and \fBq\fR
to quit. Any unrecognized key will be ignored.
.PP
All processes or threads that have exited are displayed grayed for the same time
as is visible in the \fBGRAPH\fR column or 3 seconds when it is hidden. The
invalid data points in the \fBGRAPHS\fR column are displayed inverse or with
letter \fBx\fR (see option \fB\-\-dead\-x\fR and \fBx\fR shortcut). When using
unicode characters each position contains two datapoints and only the positions
with two invalid data points are reversed.
.PP
It is possible for threads of a process to have different priority from their
main process. This is shown with \fB!\fR in the \fBPRIO\fR column of the main
process as e.g. \fB!be/4\fR.
.PP
Threads activity is always aggregated with and shown inside the main process.
.PP
When showing threads, they always appear below their main process and are sorted
in the same way as the processes.
.PP
There are two ways to change the IO priority of a process or thread \- press
\fBi\fR and use arrows to select the process or thread from the visible ones on
screen or press \fBi\fR and type its TID (PID and TID have the same value for
the main process). Then use \fBtab\fR and arrows to change the priority value
and confirm with \fBenter\fR. Shortcuts \fBesc\fR or \fBq\fR will cancel this
mode.
.PP
To change the UID and PID filters, press \fBf\fR and use \fBtab\fR to select the
UID or PID field, then type the numerical id or \fBn\fR to remove the filter and
confirm with \fBenter\fR. Filtering is always done by \fBTID\fR because it is
unique. Note that for the main process PID is the same as TID. Shortcuts
\fBesc\fR or \fBq\fR will cancel this mode.
.PP
Starting with Linux kernel 5.14.x task_delayacct is configurable at runtime and
set to off by default. This setting can be changed in interactive mode by the
\fBCtrl\-T\fR shortcut. In batch mode a warning is printed when the setting is
OFF. From the command line this can be enabled by:
.RS

.B
$ sudo sysctl kernel.task_delayacct=1

.RE
and disabled again by:
.RS

.B
$ sudo sysctl kernel.task_delayacct=0

.RE
It is advisable to keep this option off when not using this or another
monitoring program because when enabled it has some effect on system
performance.

.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-batch\fR

Useful for logging I/O usage over time
.TP
\fB\-n\fR \fINUM\fR, \fB\-\-iter\fR=\fINUM\fR

This is most useful in non\-interactive mode
.TP
\fB\-d\fR \fISEC\fR, \fB\-\-delay\fR=\fISEC\fR
Set the delay between iterations in seconds (1 second by default).
Accepts non\-integer values such as 1.1 seconds
.TP

The value will always be resolved first unless it is prefixed by \fB+\fR in
which case it is treated as numeric only. Values that do not resolve but appear
to be numeric are used as numeric

.TP
\fB\-\-no\-processes\fR

amount of I/O processes have done since the process or \fBiotop\fR started.
Note that this option and \-\-accum\-bw are exclusive and they will turn each

The original Python iotop implementation was written by Guillaume Chazarain.
This rewrite in C was started in 2014 by Vyacheslav Trushkin and reworked to
include all missing features from the original Python code and several new ones
from 2020 to 2025 by Boian Bonev.
